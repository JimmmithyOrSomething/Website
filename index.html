        <p>-Ice Bear</p>
        <p>Ice Bear is one of the three main characters from the animated series <strong>We Bare Bears</strong>, created by Daniel Chong. Ice Bear is the most stoic and mysterious of the three bears. He is the youngest of the three brothers—Grizzly, Panda, and himself—and is known for his cool and composed demeanor. Unlike Grizzly, who is outgoing and Panda, who is sensitive, Ice Bear is quiet, calm, and prefers to be alone or engage in very specific activities, such as cooking or martial arts.</p>
